 This sample is a .NET console app and demonstrates how one can process Inventor **Assemblies** or **Parts** on Design Automation. In particular it takes a design (Assembly or Part) and changes parameters inside of it (height and width). Input designs can be found in **Solution/clientApp/inputFiles/**. Values for changing params are in Program.cs
